      "Predicting the strongest Pokémon in 2026 is challenging because Pokémon games and media are constantly evolving, and new Pokémon are regularly introduced. However, based on current trends and the Pokémon Company's history of balancing and introducing new Pokémon, we can make an educated guess.\n",

      "As of now, the strongest Pokémon in the current games (such as Pokémon Sword and Shield, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and others) are often those with high base stats, powerful moves, and good typing. For example, in the current generation, Pokémon like Groudon, Kyogre, and Rayquaza are considered very powerful due to their high stats and access to strong moves.\n",

      "If we were to speculate about 2026, it's likely that the strongest Pokémon will be those introduced in the next generation of games, which is expected to be Pokémon Legends: Arceus's sequel. This sequel is rumored to be set in the Galar region and will likely introduce new Pokémon with unique abilities and movesets.\n",

However, based on the patterns of the past, the strongest Pokémon in 2026 will likely be those with a combination of high stats, access to powerful moves, and advantageous typing. The exact Pokémon will depend on the game's mechanics and the balance decisions made by the developers.\n",
